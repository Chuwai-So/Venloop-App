Week 3:


__Context:__

For our fourth project, we plan to collaborate with Venloop to develop an application that enhances the "Avond4Daagse" event experience. The goal is to improve the experience for all participants while providing a platform that unites people through sports and an active lifestyle.
Based on the interview we conducted, we found that Venloop places great importance on including everyone equally and creating a memorable group experience. The event is primarily aimed at school classes from Venlo, who walk different distances over four consecutive days, adjusted to their respective age groups.

__Problem Statement__:

Until now, Venloop has organized the "Avond4Daagse" event as a four-day walk for school classes without any additional digital support. However, the organization now wishes for an application that adds value to the event, enhances the experience for all participants, and ensures that everyone can equally take part.
The main challenges are:

Ease of Use: The primary users are elementary school children, so the app must be intuitive and easy to use.
Safety: The routes will pass through normal traffic without road closures, so safety features need to be integrated into the app.
Accessibility: Since not every child might own a smartphone, the solution must be designed in a way that not every participant needs their own device.

__Proposed Solution: Treasure Hunt-Based Application__

To meet the requirements, we propose a web-based application built around a Treasure Hunt system. Here are the key features of the solution:

Team-Based Usage:
The app should be operated by a "teamleader" per team, who manages navigation and enters results.
Alternatively, multiple team members could access the app to input tasks.

Diverse Routes and Checkpoints:
Teams will walk different routes on each of the four days to provide variety.
Checkpoints: At specific points, there will be tasks, questions, or items to collect, such as small puzzles, photo tasks, or trivia about landmarks along the route.

Motivation through Gamification:
Points System: Teams earn points for completed tasks, which will be evaluated at the end of each day.
Achievements and Rewards: Digital badges or small prizes can further motivate participants.

Easy Management for Organizers:
Organizers can easily add and manage tasks and checkpoints.
It needs to be decided whether the routes should be pre-defined or dynamically generated.

Focus on Safety:
Tasks can only be completed within a defined radius around the checkpoints to prevent cheating.
Safety alerts will be displayed when participants approach street crossings.

Time-Based Challenges (Optional):
The app could track the time taken for certain segments to add an additional layer of competition.
However, safety must remain a top priority.


**Further discussion:**

1. To what extent is the Venloop team willing to prepare the game by, for example, hiding objectives or creating checkpoints? -> How should some kind of adminpanel look to add new checkpoints?
2. Is it possible to only focus on one age group (older kids), because then we could work with routes that are up to 5km or 10km, which would simplify the development process for us and for them.
3. Should we include badges or achievements? -> How is this possible without accounts?
