On May 8th, the development team held a Sprint Review meeting with the project stakeholder, Mr. Kessels, to evaluate the progress of the previous sprint.

The team began by presenting the completed sprint increments as committed in the prior review. These deliverables included:
	•	Admin functionalities: Full CRUD capabilities for teams and tasks, as well as handling admin account verification requests.
	•	Team Leader functionalities: The ability for team leaders to join and participate in events via QR code scanning.
	•	General features: Basic user authentication (login/sign-up) and foundational security measures.
	•	UI/UX Implementation: A functional and presentable user interface, aligned with stakeholder expectations—although not the primary focus of this sprint.

Mr. Kessels expressed satisfaction with the team’s progress and noted that the team and stakeholder maintain a strong alignment regarding the project’s direction.

Following the presentation, the stakeholder introduced several new feature requests:
	1.	Universal QR Code for Team Join: Replace team-specific QR codes with a single universal QR code that, when scanned, allows the user to choose from a list of available teams.
	2.	Team Completion Statistics: After scanning a task QR code, users should be able to see how many teams have already completed the task.
    3.  In Team Detail page, the user should be able to see a Q&A section regarding the most asked quesitons of the event and the organization. 

Lastly, Mr. Kessels emphasized his expectation to see the full project deployed by next week. To that end, the team has scheduled a follow-up meeting on May 15th, during which the requested features will be delivered. If all goes according to plan, deployment logistics will also be addressed in that session.
