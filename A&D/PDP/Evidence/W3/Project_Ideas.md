Context:

For our fourth project, we plan to collaborate with Venloop to develop an application that enhances the "Avond4Daagse" event experience. The goal is to improve the experience for all participants while providing a platform that unites people through sports and an active lifestyle.
Based on the interview we conducted, we found that Venloop places great importance on including everyone equally and creating a memorable group experience. The event is primarily aimed at school classes from Venlo, who walk different distances over four consecutive days, adjusted to their respective age groups.

Problem Statement:

Until now, Venloop has organized the "Avond4Daagse" event as a four-day walk for school classes without any additional digital support. However, the organization now wishes for an application that adds value to the event, enhances the experience for all participants, and ensures that everyone can equally take part.
The main challenges are:

Ease of Use: The primary users are elementary school children, so the app must be intuitive and easy to use.
Safety: The routes will pass through normal traffic without road closures, so safety features need to be integrated into the app.
Accessibility: Since not every child might own a smartphone, the solution must be designed in a way that not every participant needs their own device.

Proposed Solution: Treasure Hunt-Based Application

To meet the requirements, we propose a web-based application built around a Treasure Hunt system. Here are the key features of the solution:

A) Team-Based Usage:
The app should be operated by a „game-master" per team, who manages navigation and enters results.
Alternatively, multiple team members could access the app to input task results, see the progress or access the tasks.
The „game-master“ is the only group member that can access the current task and input results for the team. - we suggest an adult or „Venloop“ team member 

B) Diverse Routes and Checkpoints:
Teams will walk different routes on each of the four days to provide variety.
The routes are predefined by „Venloop“, to avoid heavy traffic.
At specific points, there will be tasks, questions, or items to collect, such as small puzzles, photo tasks, or trivia about landmarks along the route.

C) Motivation:
Points System: Teams earn points for completed tasks, which will be evaluated at the end of each day.
Achievements and Rewards: Digital badges or small prizes can further motivate participants.

D) Easy Management for Organizers:
Organizers can easily add and manage tasks and checkpoints.
Easy „game-master“ registration and team creation during the event.

E) Optionals/Add-ons:
Time-Based Challenges:
The app could track the time taken for certain segments to add an additional layer of competition.
However, safety must remain a top priority.
Challenge Mode:
Teams could challenge other teams at certain (and fitting) tasks.
Presence Check:
The presence of team members can be checked in the app and would enable the granting of points based on participation percentage to motivate the members to participate on all four days
