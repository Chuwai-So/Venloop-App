This is the first week after we have delievered the demo to our customer. After consulting with our project coach, we decided we will be first updating our artfecats in order to uphold the engineering process.

The team quickly gets to work. The team has already updated the project charter and its related artefacts such as the user stories and use case diagram to fit the current project scope. This also include a rework on the team's [project board](https://github.com/orgs/FontysVenlo/projects/592/views/1). 

This week's tasks might seem light compare to the previous weeks, but this lay the foundation for the coming project weeks, even though there were no coding involved.
