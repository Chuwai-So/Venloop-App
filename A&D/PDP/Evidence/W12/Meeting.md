On May 15th, the development team held a Sprint Review meeting with the project stakeholder, Mr. Kessels, to evaluate the progress of the previous sprint.

In the previous meeting, the team and Mr.Kessels have alreay agreed on the major feature of the application, so this meeting was more to finalize design details, deployment issue and final testing. From last meeting, the team agreed to deliver the following features:
    -Q&A Section 
    -Universal QR Code for team sign in
    -Completion notification
After demoing on this feature, Mr.Kessel were pleased with our progress. He also made the following new requests:
    -All dutch UI
    -Disclaimer
During the final testing, the team realized that in the case where the user uses a private or incognito mode in Safari, there is a chance that the token for team identification cant be recognized. Due to the short time window before the deployment, the team agrees to put up a notificatio for all users to switch to another tab or public browser window during usage.

The next meeting will be held approx. in 2 weeks for the feedback of the actual user, so the team can work on it even more. Meanwhile the team will fix their github board to upholad the project engineering process.
