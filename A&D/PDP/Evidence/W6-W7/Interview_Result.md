We held a meeting with our stakeholders on Thursday, and it was a very fruitful session.
Mr. Kessels approved our vision for the project, confirming that we had correctly identified the client’s needs.

To ensure alignment on all levels, we asked a series of follow-up questions for clarification.

⸻

 Design & Visuals
	•	Stakeholders will provide a pattern book containing preferred color schemes and design patterns.
	•	The platform should feel educational and fun for its users.
	•	Leaderboards will be hidden during the competition for safety reasons.

⸻

 Admin & User Management
	•	The admin panel will be desktop-responsive (not limited to mobile).
	•	User verification will be handled by the Venloop organization:
	•	Users submit access requests.
	•	A verification email will be sent to Venloop.
	•	Once confirmed, the dev team will manually add the user to the backend.
	•	Admins are responsible for creating and naming teams.
	•	Participants cannot create their own teams.
	•	Each team is tied to a school.
	•	Multiple adults can act as team leaders.

⸻

 What Not to Include
	•	No presence check feature via the app is required.
	•	No preference for hosting provider — deployment options are flexible.

⸻

Functionality Preferences
	•	Tasks may be created in advance, but the final decision lies with admins.
	•	The platform must include content deletion options.
	•	Data should be automatically removable after 30 days to maintain database hygiene.

⸻

 Event & User Context
	•	27 schools are expected to participate.
	•	One school is expected to be especially active (~300 participants).
	•	The QR code feature is seen as a valuable addition.
