This is a summary of our in person meeting during the first day of the project week. This meeting not only made some significant changes to our plan, but it also laid some important foundations to our project. The first matter we addressed is the upcoming interview with our key stakeholder, Mr.Kessels from the Venloop Org. As the top priority today, we prepared the interview questions and rehearsed our response. 

Today we created our dev and personal branch in our project repo, which marks the official begins of our implementation phase of the project. Since our last meeting, the team decides to stick with Firebase as our backend. It also serve as the Hosting service since it provides a complete package. We achieved one of our important milestone today by showing a successful writing attempt to the newly created firebase backend through a simple frontend demo with React.Js. I have tasked myself through the Github Board to finish the rest of the backend setup which includes the tables and their subsequent test cases.

Another key takeaway from our meeting is that we decides to change the framework from React.Js to Next.Js. This decision was made because after our research, Next.Js will fit more for our project scope since it can handle complex routing better than react, which is one of our core features, the ability to split signing from admin and normal team user through different entries. Not only that, serving as a comprehensive add on to the React framework, it also provides more powerful features and it wont have any conflicts of our React learning goal.  It is also worth to mention that the conversion from our previous React codebase to Next codebase is already done. 

One last thing, since everyone of us has chosen frontend and design as learning goals, we decided the best way for us to learn from each other is that we will all deliver one's own design on the Leaderboard panels. Any use of css framework or npm package is allowed as long as it is compatible with our Next.Js codebase. We would compare the designs preferably on Thursday, this way we can ask the stakeholders to do a Five Second Test which is part of the Frontend Development Principle to see whose design is the most intuitive one.
