This is a summary of the team and i had discussed. We had first worked on our upcoming pitch with [this proposal](./Pitch_Proposal.md). This proposal is not yet our final drafts but will be our starting point. 

Then we talked briefly about the situation with our project charter, since we are still unclear about certain parts and details such as WBS and conclusion, we did not move on to compile the whole but rather we refine on our completed part individually throughout the week until further notices. [Here](./Project_Charter_Chuwai.pdf) is the part i have done.

After that we discussed a lot for our design choices on Admin Panels. The team compared each others design, but does not have a definitive winner at first. We mostly have differences on how will the admin user approaches the task template, the looks of a task preview panel and whether the admin panel should have options to sort of managing the events. After weighing the pros and cons, the team have decided on the final version of the Admin panel, which we will show in the upcoming weeks as an artifact. Me personally has learn lot about UI/UX throughout this discussion. I always want to cut corners when it comes to designing the frontend aspects of an application in a sense that i assume users will appreciate more with the least amount of panels therefore i would often put all the options on a page, however, i neglect the fact that users also strive for visual clarity. Separation of concerns not only works on the backend for developers, but also for users.

The team then proceeds to research on the Tech-Stacks for this project, specifically the frontend aspect. We have made [this](./compare_1.png) for us to better draw conclusions. After discussion we have decided to use React.js as our frontend framework based on the fact this is fairly simple to learn, massive community and it is easy to maintain. I am excited to learn more about this frontend framework since this is the experience and knowledge that i lack from previous project. 

The team has not yet made a decisive conclusion on the backend Tech-Stack, so we will need to do more research on this topic on ourselves throughout next week. I tasked myself to present a workable backend demo next week. 

About personal development and feedbacks, my teammates told me that i have made improvements regarding the assignment, they agree that i am on the right track. Felix told me that in addition to my weaknesses, i should not given up the chances to further strengthen my strong-suits. So i made some adjustments on the PDP based on his advices. I also gave feedbacks on Aleks's use case diagram. I told him that there minor issues with naming, and the diagram should be overall more readable. I was told that i was being professional and not confrontational during all conducts.
