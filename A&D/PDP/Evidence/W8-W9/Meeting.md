From the previous session, the team made decisions on choosing backend frameworks and we also decided to compare design choices for the leaderboard user story. In the end we even though preferred Alex's design which looks slick and responsive, but after checking with our stakeholder, this is no longer a part of the core user story anymore.

For this sprint, which is one week away from our MVP delivery, the team were tasked to deliver the minial required user stories as reqeusted from the stakeholder. I personally was in charge of creating all the fundemental APIs for different service with the majority of them being tested, and to host the application through firebase hosting. It was backend heavy for me, which is not what i expected, but i will do whatever it takes for the team. Meanwhilem, i am still contacting the stakeholders to iron out a few details, making sure we are all on the same page on things. Finally, we adjusted our git board to allign more with the engineering process, putting individual user stories first, and the relating tasks later, we can clearly see who is working on what, at which stage.
