For this short sprint, i got tasked to choose the appropriate frontend test framework for our project. Since i didnt took the FRED module this semster, i went personally to Mr Kouzak, the lecturer for this module to find some insights regarding this topic. 

After understand our scope and the task at hands, he suggested that we should strive for a E2E test framework for the frontend part. Reason being that we have already backend API test in place that made sure all the services provide the correct response, and we should rely on an user experience test for the actual UI/UX test, the E2E test is perfect for our current situation. E2E test, or End-to-End test, is a type of automated testing that simulates real-word user. Rather on fixiating on designing details, the E2E test focus more whether the experience works as intended. It think of the whole system as a black box, the user dont need to know how it works, but the user need to know that whole box indeed works. This is where we should focus on. 

For the testing framework, i choose the Cypress frameowork. This framework is suggested first thing in the offical Next.js Info Page regarding testing within Next.js. This framework is indeed very easy to use, it can simulate user behavior such as clicks or types, and it can test across mulitple pages, which is very helpful for componded functions such as task submission. I tried it out personally, and finish testing with two scenarios, the admin login and team sign in. I will present my research outcome to the team next week.
