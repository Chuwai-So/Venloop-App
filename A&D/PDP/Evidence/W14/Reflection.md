This document served as a general reflection about my goals that i setted up in the beginning of the semester relating to the Learning goal 1 and 2, and the project as a whole.

Our project is to provide an extension for the upcoming Avond4Daagse event organzied by the local organization, Venloop. I was very excited for this expierence since it is my first time to be working with an actual customer instead of our coaches to pretend one. It makes me feels like i could make change in the real world and an execellent oppoturnity for me to better myself in the field of software engineering. Therefore, these are the goals i set up for myself:
    -Regarding LG1(executing project on lvl2 of HBO-i Framwork):
        -Stable, continous communication with Stakeholders through out project, in order for me to understand how to provide a better service;
        -Build backend system for the application under test-driven enviroment, for supporting the project;
        -Deepend UI/UX knowledge by getting more hands on in this project since this is the professional area that i lack of in previous projects;
   -Regarding LG2(applies professional skill in lvl2):
        -Managing the project in an agile way, have more direct involvment in the big picutre; 
        -Handling feedbacks, reflect, and improve;
To put in short, i think i see progress in these areas, but it still needs more improvement in the future, and i will break them down in the coming sections.

For the project as a whole, we follow and deliever what our stakeholders requested from us on a timely manner, but unfortunatley the project was deemed as a failure per our stakeholders, since there were little to no customer who actually to try the project out. A heavy blow of course, but it still let me learn a lot along the way.

Regarding the communication goal, i would say i am really satisfied with what i accomplished during this project. I was in previous project not that guy who talks to the stakeholder directly, or at least did not play a significant role in communication, but not anymore. I am the leading communicator during this project. I sent multiple emails, bridging the development team and the stakeholders, attend every meeting there is with the stakeholders with documentation, and even after all is said and done, i did not forget to create customer feedback survey witht the team, so we can still learn more about our project even the project is a failure. This is without a doubt a huge progress for me on this front, so it should be fair to say i completed this goal.

Regarding backend design, i design and deploy the project backend system with tesing done in the early stage. I also helped develop the early model of the token system. Even though i mainly worked on the backend in previous projects, i just think i should not totally abondon it in this project. I have also learn some new tech along the way. It is the first time that i work with google firebase, and it is refreshing to use a such a simple yet powerful tool compares to loopback and Render. It is much more stable and requires much less setup. It utilizes NoSQL as its core database structure with nodes, which is quite different from what i used to with SQL DB. Its flexibale structure allows me to manipulate the DB easily, but since it so loose, some bugs were clearly caused by the lack of constraints enforcements. Move on to testing, i choose vitest as the testing framework for all the service tests. There are more service functions that pops out during the development that needs further testing, but all in all the service testing was an OK experience for me. I can't say we 100 percent follow through the test driven development principal through and through, but a good amount of testing were done for vital cases and services. Some tests could be better structured, since some of them created too many junk data in the DB. For the future testing, we need to rely more on mocking tests. However, the same thing cant be said for the Token system. It was a great idea for access control, it also did its job as intended, but the problem lies in the underlying architecure. Maybe it is cause by miscommunicaiton or the lack of it, we have a hard time to figure out where the token is stored, why is the token duplicated or even why it wasnt generated in the first place. Me and the team will address this issue in this final sprint. As a conclusion, i would say i am about 70% done with this goal, but i have confidence to finish it before the assessments.

Next i should disguss is my experience with UI/UX design, which is a new field for me. I learnt a lot of new concepts and ideas for the project. For starter, our core UI/UX idea is to aim for Minimalism, that has clear interfaces that only focused on key actions, which leads to intuitive navigation for the users. Not only that, we also implemented few Visual feedbacks and Confirmation to prevent user confusion, therefore build their confidence while using the system. This app needs to have a role-based interface implementatoin, the desktop view for the admin user and Mobile-first expierence for the other user. This was a bit challenging but we managed to push it through. For this project, we choose Next Js as our core framwork of the project, reason being that it is an extended version of the popular framework React Js but with extra features such as simplified Router system, which is a plus for our project since our project needs to be robust for its access control. I watched youtube tutorial for it, but most of the things i learn was done by doing the actual work. For me i was tasked to create the team-detail and admin sign up page. Needless to say it wasnt all smooth sailing since it took me a while to decide for the look and layout, but i did deliver works that are accepted from my peers. I have receieved further feedbacks, and i will adjust them accordingly in the coming sprint. I also did the frontend testing for this goal. After consulting with Mr Kouzak, i chose Cypress as our E2E frontend testing framework since it is suggessted by Next.Js. I see the purpose of E2E testing, and it trully does reflect how the user actually use the applicaiton, but i dont have such kind words of Cypress. It turns out Cypress might execute some methods multiple times without us noticing it during its testing time, which cause unexpected behaviour, this includes it accidently wipes out the entire database! To put it simply, i did accomplish the goals i setted in the beginning, but due the fact the scope get larger, and more moving parts involved, i have some unfinished works with this area. Hope i can tie them all up in the final sprint.

Moving on to the LG2 goals, the team agile management. In previous projects, me and my team did not utilize the agile method and the scrum board to its full potential. This time, however, we did try our very best to uphold it the early stage. We created and updates our artefacts as time goes on, but since our stakeholder expect us to deliever a working prototype during the development process, some of its ceremonies and engineering process was not followed to its full extents due to this time contraints. Sometimes i questioned whether these rigoursous are as useful as them claimed, since we did deliever the thing we promised to our stakeholder on time, but looking back, we had some really clutching moments due to the miscommunication in the first place. I would say i still need to do better on this front and have more faith. 

Finally, the feeback itself. I was not good handle criticisms and reflections, i always thought they were a waste of time, but not anymore. I did a pretty good job of hold records and reflection for this semester, as you can see from my PDP. I am seeing progress on this front. 

Even though the project might be a failure, but these personal growth aren't. I still learn a lot from this expierence, and i hope i can keep on moving on. 

Update: We just had our final talk with our stakeholder. What a journey for me. I had learn quite a lot from this project, from learning how to talk to actual client, discover what they truly want and deliver the project they like. When i thought i knew everything, turns out i was terriblely wrong about it. I had completely negelcted the part where the success of project is not entirely depend on the physical project itself, but also how to present it, where to present, and most importantly for our case, when to present it. The miss management on timing was something that nobody saw coming, where the schools had barely anytime to prepare for our idea. And the other point is that the schools and parents are already overburden by the fact that they need to look over the kids in busy traffic, can we make it even more simple? But on the other hand, if we had more time to prepare and present, we might be able to tweak the project to a state where it is not only a app for a short lesiure, but also help the school to better manage the kids. But these doesnt matter now. What matter is what i learnt from this expierence, and i am truly grateful to be part of it whether it is success or not.
